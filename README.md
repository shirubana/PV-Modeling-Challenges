# PVPMC-Challenge-2021
 
This repository shows the modeling steps, intermediate resutls and final results submitted for bifacialVF and SAM (pySAM) models for the [2021 PVPMC Blind Modeling Round Robin](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/pv-research/blind-pv-modeling-comparison/).

All files used are included:
- Weather file processing into TMY3 and SAM
- pySAM loading of SAM simulation jsons, modifications and compiling. NOTC temperature model used.
- bifacialVF front, rear, and electrical mismatch calculations, plus PVlib single diode modeling from the CEC parameters of the modules and SAPM model for temperature.
